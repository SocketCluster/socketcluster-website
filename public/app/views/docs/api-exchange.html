        <h1>API - SCExchange (SCBroker)</h1>
        <p>
          Can be accessed using SCWorker.exchange property.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exchange object is a top-level scBroker client which lets you publish events and manipulate data within your brokers - It represents a cluster of 1 or more brokers.
          You can use any method of an scBroker client on instances of this object (see <a href="https://github.com/SocketCluster/sc-broker#client-methods">scBroker Client</a>).
          Note that the hashing function used by the SCExchange object to shard actions/channels accross brokers can be found in the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sc-hasher">sc-hasher</a>
          module - You can use this function in your code to help with sharding (advanced use case).
          See <a href="https://github.com/SocketCluster/socketcluster/issues/245#issuecomment-261041729">this comment</a> for details.

                  this <code>SCExchange</code> object will inherit all the methods of the scBroker Client documented <a href="https://github.com/SocketCluster/sc-broker#client-methods">here</a>.
                  So for example, if you want to store data to share accross all your worker processes, you could call
                  <code>worker.exchange.set('myCustomVariable', {foo: 'Hello world'}, function (err) { /*...*/ })</code>.
                  Then <code>worker.exchange.get('myCustomVariable', function (err, data) { /* data will be {foo: 'Hello world'} */ })</code>.
                  Make sure that <code>err</code> is handled within the callback if it exists.

              This method is a wrapper around the <a href="https://github.com/SocketCluster/sc-broker#run">scBroker run</a> method.
              The queryFn function will be executed directly on one of your brokers and the result will be passed back to your callback.
              If your SC instance has more than one broker, the queryFn will be executed on the first one by default - In order to spread
              the load evenly between all your brokers, you should add a <b>mapIndex</b> key to your queryFn before you pass it to the run method.
              For example, if you wanted to map to a specific broker based on a string stored in channelName you would just go: queryFn.mapIndex = channelName;
              then you just pass it to exchange.run(queryFn, ...) as normal.

            <td>setMapper(mapper)</td>
            <td>
              Allows you to define a mapping function which is used to map specific broker actions to specific broker processes in order to
              distribute the load between them (assuming you have more than 1 broker). This mapping function is particularly important
              for the subscribe and publish actions as it decides which brokers will handle what channel names. This is only for advanced use cases.

            <td>
              Returns the current mapping function which is used to map specific broker actions to specific broker processes.
              For the publish and subscribe actions, the default mapping function will shard channels such that each broker will
              handle approximately (1/n)th of all channels (where n is the number of brokers). This is only for advanced use cases.

          <tr>
            <td>send(data, mapIndex, callback)</td>
            <td>
              Send data to one or more brokers. mapIndex can be a number, a string, an array of strings or null.
              If mapIndex is a number, it will cause the message to be sent to the broker with that id.
              If mapIndex is a string, it will be hashed to a number and the message will be sent to the relevant broker.
              If mapIndex is an array (of strings or numbers), the message will be sent to multiple brokers.
              If mapIndex is null, the message will be sent to all brokers.
              You can listen for the data on the broker (in broker.js) using <code>broker.on('message', function (data, respond) {})</code> -
              The respond function is a callback which can be invoked with <code>respond(err, data)</code>.

        <p>
          Because the exchange object potentially handles a cluster of local brokers, you can optionally use the
          setMapper(mapperFn) method to set a function which will be used to map individual scBroker actions to one of your
          brokers (assuming you have more than one). Changing the default mapper is an advanced use case though and you generally don't need to do it.
          The mapperFn takes three arguments:

        <table class="table">
          <tr>
            <td>key</td>
            <td>
              The key/keyChain (typically string or Array) which is was passed to this scBroker client method/action.
              If the method is 'query' then the key will be an scBroker query function which you will have to interpret in order to come up with a mapping.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>method</td>
            <td>The scBroker method which was invoked and needs to be mapped to one or more broker processes.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>clientIds</td>
            <td>An array of available scBroker client IDs which you can map to.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          The mapper must return either an ID (integer) or an array of IDs and SC will send the action to all corresponding brokers.
          So if the mapperFn returns 0, then the action wil be sent to scBroker broker with ID 0.
          If you return the clientIds array directly, then all clients will receive the action.

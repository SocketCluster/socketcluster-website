        <h1>API - Global (nData)</h1>
        <p>
          Can be accessed using scWorker.global property.
        </p>
        <p>
          The global object is a top-level nData client which lets you publish events and manipulate data within your brokers.
          It also lets you passively watch channels (those which clients of the current server are subscribed to) or you can explicitly
          subscribe to channels to let you watch additional channels.
          You can use any method of an nData client on instances of this object: <a href="https://github.com/SocketCluster/ndata">https://github.com/SocketCluster/ndata</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Because this object potentially handles a cluster of brokers,
          you can use the setMapper(mapperFn) method to set a function which will be used to map your individual nData client calls to one of your 
          brokers (assuming you have more than one).
          The mapperFn takes three arguments:
        </p>
        <br />
        <table class="table">
          <tr>
            <td>key</td>
            <td>
              The key/keyChain (typically string or Array but can also be a function) which is was passed to this nData client method/action.
              If the method is 'query' then the key will be an nData query function which you will have to interpret in order to come up with a mapping.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>method</td>
            <td>The nData method which was invoked and needs to be mapped to one or more broker processes.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>clientIds</td>
            <td>An array of available nData client IDs which you can map to.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <br />
        <p>
          The mapper must return either an ID (integer) or an array of IDs and SC will send the action to all corresponding brokers.
          So if the mapperFn returns 0, then the action wil be sent to nData broker with ID 0.
          If you return the clientIds array directly, then all clients will receive the action.
        </p>

              Subscribe this global nData client to the specified channel.
              This function returns a <a href="/#!/docs/api-channel">Channel</a> object which lets you watch for incoming data on that channel.

              You can reactivate the <a href="/#!/docs/api-channel">Channel</a> object by calling subscribe(channelName) again at a later time.

              This is different from subscribe() in that it will not try to subscribe to that channel.
              The returned channel will be inactive initially. You can call channel.subscribe() later to activate that channel when required.

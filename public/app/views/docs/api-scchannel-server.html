        <h1>API - SCChannel (Server)</h1>
        <p>
          Instances of the SCChannel object let you subscribe to and watch for incoming data which is published on that channel by other clients or publishers.
          This object is the server-side equivalent to the client-side <a href="#!/docs/api-scchannel-client">SCChannel</a> object.

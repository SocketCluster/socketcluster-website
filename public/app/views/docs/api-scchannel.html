        <h1>API - SCChannel (Client)</h1>
        <p>
          Instances of the SCChannel object let you subscribe to and watch for incoming data which is published on that channel by other clients or the server.
          This object is the client-side equivalent to the server-side <a href="#!/docs/api-channel">Channel</a> object.
        </p>

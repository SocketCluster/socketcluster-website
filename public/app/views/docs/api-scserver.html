        <h1>API - SCServer</h1>
        <p>
        This instance is returned from the call to worker.getSCServer().
        It represents your realtime (WebSocket) server object which you can use to listen for incoming realtime socket connections.
        This object inherits from engine.io's Server object so you have access to all the properties and methods of an engine.io server
        but with some additions.
        </p>

              For example, when you provide a callback to socket.emit() on the client (it will expect a response from the server).

              Emitted as soon as a new SCSocket object is created on the server - This occurs at the beginning of the 
              client handshake, before the 'connection' event. You should not try to send events to the socket while it is in this state.

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>'connection'</td>
            <td>
              Emitted whenever a new socket connection is established. The listener to this event receives 
              an socket (SCSocket) object as argument which can be used to interact with that client.

          <tr>
            <td>'badSocketAuthToken'</td>
            <td>
              Emitted when a client tries to authenticate itself with an invalid (or expired) token.
              The first argument passed along with this event is the SCSocket object, and the second one is the JWT error object.
              This error object has an additional ecryptedAuthToken property which holds the encrypted token
              which failed the verification step.

              <p>
                Lets you add middleware functions which can be used to manage client access control to various features of the SCServer.
                This is useful for monitoring realtime data flows and also to block access to restricted channels and resources.
                Note that only actions from clients pass through middleware. Server-side calls to scServer.global.publish() do not.

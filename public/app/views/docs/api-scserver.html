        <p>
          This instance is returned from the call to worker.getSCServer(). It represents your
          real-time (WebSocket) server object which you can use to listen for incoming
          real-time socket connections. This object inherits from engine.io's Server
          object so you have access to all the properties and methods of an engine.io
          server but with some additions.

              <p>
                Lets you set a custom codec engine. This allows you to specify how data gets encoded before being sent over the wire and how it gets decoded once it reaches the other side.
                The codecEngine must be an object which exposes an <code>encode(object)</code> and a <code>decode(encodedData)</code> function. The encode function can return any data type - Comonly a string or a Buffer/ArrayBuffer.
                The decode function needs to return a JavaScript object which adheres to the <a href="https://github.com/SocketCluster/socketcluster/blob/master/socketcluster-protocol.md">SC protocol</a>.
                The idea of using a custom codec is that it allows you to compress SC packets in any format you like (optimized for any use case) - By decoding these packets back into their original protocol form, SC will be able process them appropriately.
                Note that if you provide a codec engine on the server, you need to provide the same codecEngine as an option when you create the client socket (see 'codecEngine' option <a href="#!/docs/api-socketcluster-client">here</a>).
                The default codec engine used by SC is <a href="https://github.com/SocketCluster/sc-formatter/blob/master/index.js">here</a>.
                If you make an interesting codec engine/module which you feel might be useful for other developers, please feel free to share it with the rest of the SC community.

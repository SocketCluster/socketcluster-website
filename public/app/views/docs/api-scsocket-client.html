        <h1>API - SCSocket (Client)</h1>
        <p>
          Note that there are two types of SCSocket objects - One which runs on the client and another which runs on the server.
          These two objects have slightly different APIs. This page concerns the client socket.
        </p>
        <p>
          The client-side SCSocket object allows you to interact with your backend and with other client sockets in real-time.
          The SCSocket object uses WebSockets the underlying transport (since v2.0.0, there is no polling fallback).
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the biggest differences between the client-side SCSocket and server-side SCSocket is that a client-side SCSocket is not ephemeral and will not be
          be discarded when it loses the connection - By default, it will try to reconnect automatically.
        </p>

              <pre class="prettyprint">{
  // The socket's id
  id: 'RM11Szl-tPn7p1BhAAAA',

              The second argument is a callback function (<code>processSubscriptions</code>) which, when called, will send all pending channel subscriptions to the server (to start activating pending channels).
              Note that this <code>processSubscriptions</code> callback will only work if the client <code>socket.options.autoSubscribeOnConnect</code> option is set to <code>false</code>. See <a href="/#!/docs/api-socketcluster-client">SocketCluster Client API</a>.

          To check the type of an error in SC, you should use the <code>name</code> property of the error (do not use the instanceof statement).
          Errors which are sent to the client from the server will be dehydrated on the server and rehydrated on the client - As a result they will be cast
          to plain <code>Error</code> objects.

              This is the same as Socket.io's emit function except that if a callback is provided, your server-side socket will need to respond to this event - <a href="#!/docs/handling-failure">See example</a>.
              Also note that SC has a default timeout of 10 seconds for responding to events on the other side. You can increase this limit by setting <code>ackTimeout</code> when
              initiating SocketCluster on the server side. See <a href="#!/docs/api-socketcluster">here</a>.

              emitted the event (assuming that the server is expecting a response - I.e. A callback was provided to the emit method).
              The res function is in the form: res(err, message) - To send back an error, you can do either: res('This is an error') or
              res(1234, 'This is the error message for error code 1234').

              Typically, you should perform server-initiated authentication using the socket.setAuthToken() method from the server side.
              This method is useful if, for example, you received the token from a different browser tab via localStorage and you want to immediately
              authenticate the current socket without having to reconnect the socket. It may also be useful if you're getting the token from a third-party
              JWT-based system and you're using the same authKey (see boot options for SocketCluster) - In which case they should be compatible.

              The callback lets you check that the publish action reached the backend successfully.
              Callback function is in the form callback(err, ackData) - On success, the err argument will be undefined.
              The ackData argument will be a value which is passed back from back end middleware (undefined by default);

              This function returns an <a href="#!/docs/api-scchannel-client">SCChannel</a> object which lets you watch for incoming data on that channel.
              Since v4.0.0, you can provide an optional options object in the form <code>{waitForAuth: true, data: someCustomData, batch: true}</code> (all properties are optional) - If <code>waitForAuth</code> is true, the channel
              will wait for the socket to become authenticated before trying to subscribe to the server - These kinds of channels are
              sometimes known as "private channels" - Note that in this case, "authenticated" means that the client socket has received a valid JWT authToken - Read about the server-side <code>socket.setAuthToken(tokenData)</code> function <a href="/#!/docs/authentication">here</a> for more details. The <code>data</code> property can be used to pass data along with the subscription.
              See <a href="https://github.com/SocketCluster/socketcluster/issues/167#issuecomment-208313977">this comment</a> for more details about how to handle the data property.
              The <code>batch</code> property was introduced in SC v8 (both the client and the server must be at least version 8 in order to use this feature) - It's false by default; if set to true, then the subscription request will be batched together with other subscriptions instead of being sent off immediately and individually. By the default, the batch duration is 0 (which will batch subscribe calls that are within the same call stack).
              Note that the <code>pubSubBatchDuration</code> can be specified on a per-socket basis as an option when creating/connecting the socket for the first time.
              Batching can result in a significant performance boost if the client needs to subscribe to a large number of channels (will also speed up socket reconnect if there are a lot of pending channels).

              Unsubscribe from the specified channel. This makes any associated SCChannel object inactive.
              You can reactivate the <a href="#!/docs/api-scchannel-client">SCChannel</a> object by calling subscribe(channelName) again at a later time.

            <td>
              Returns an <a href="#!/docs/api-scchannel-client">SCChannel</a> instance. This is different from subscribe() in that it will not try to subscribe to that channel.
              The returned channel will be inactive initially.
              You can call channel.subscribe() later to activate that channel when required.

              Stop handling data which is published on the specified channel. This is different from unsubscribe in that the
              socket will still receive channel data but the specified handler will no longer capture it.
              If the handler argument is not provided, all handlers for that channelName will be removed.

              Any SCChannel object which is associated with that channelName will be disabled permanently (ready to be cleaned up by garbage collector).

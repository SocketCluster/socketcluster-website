        <h1>API - SCSocket (Server)</h1>
        <p>
          Note that there are two types of SCSocket objects - One which runs on the client and another which runs on the server.
          These two objects have slightly different APIs. This page concerns the server socket.
        </p>
        <p>
          The server-side SCSocket object allows you to interact with a matching client-side socket in real-time.
          It also allows you to subscribe and publish to channels. It uses the WebSocket API as the underlying transport.
        </p>

            <td>
              This gets triggered when an error occurs on this socket. Argument is the error object.

          <tr>
            <td>'raw'</td>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>'connect'</td>
            <td>
              Triggers when the socket completes the SC handshake phase and is fully connected. The argument passed to the handler is
              the socket connection status object. Note that if you capture socket inside the `scServer.on('connection', handler)` handler,
              then the 'connect' event will already have occurred and therefore won't trigger again. The 'connect' event handler can be attached
              inside the `scServer.on('handshake', handler)` handler instead.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>'disconnect'</td>
            <td>
              Happens when the client becomes disconnected from the server. Note that if the socket becomes disconnected during the SC handshake stage,
              then the <code>'connectAbort'</code> event will be triggered instead.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>'connectAbort' [since v9.1.0]</td>
            <td>
              Happens when the client disconnects from the server before the SocketCluster handshake has completed (I.e. while <code>socket.state</code> was 'connecting').
              Note that the <code>'connectAbort'</code> event can only be triggered during the socket's handshake phase before the server's <code>'connection'</code> event is triggered.

              Happens when the client disconnects from the server at any stage of the handshake/connection cycle.
              Note that this event is a catch-all for both <code>'disconnect'</code> and <code>'connectAbort'</code> events.

            <td>
              Emitted when the client tries to authenticate itself with an invalid (or expired) token.
              Note that this event will typically be triggered as part of the socket handshake (before the socket is connected); therefore, it's generally
              better to listen for the <code>'badSocketAuthToken'</code> event directly on the server instance instead.
              The argument passed along with this event is an object with the properties <code>authError</code> and <code>signedAuthToken</code>.
              The authError property holds an error object and the signedAuthToken property holds the auth token which failed the verification step.

              Note that you cannot use any of the registered SCSocket events (defined above or those specified in engine.io-client).
              This is the same as Socket.io's emit function except that if a callback is provided, your server-side socket will need to respond to this event. <a href="#!/docs/handling-failure">See example</a>.
              Also note that SC has a default timeout of 10 seconds for responding to events on the other side. You can increase this limit by setting <code>ackTimeout</code> when
              initiating SocketCluster on the server side. See <a href="#!/docs/api-socketcluster">here</a>.

              in the form: handler(data, res) - The res argument is a function which can be used to send a response to the client socket which
              emitted the event (assuming that the client is expecting a response - I.e. A callback was provided to the emit method).
              The res function is in the form: res(err, message) - To send back an error, you can do either: res('This is an error') or
              res(1234, 'This is the error message for error code 1234').
              To send back a normal non-error response: res(null, 'This is a normal response message').

              <p>
                Authenticate the current socket's client by providing it some token data which you can use to validate their identity and/or access rights.
                Generally, you should call this method in response to a successful login attempt by the client (I.e. The client has provided
                a username and password combination which exists in your database).
              </p>
              <p>
                When you call this method, a JWT (token) containing the specified data will be created and attached to both the current server socket and the client socket on the other side of the connection.
                This method can be called multiple times to update the token with new data - Avoid modifying the socket.authToken property directly because otherwise, the change will not propagate to the client.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the simplest case, the data argument to this method would be an object in the form {username: 'bob123'}.
                For a more complex use case, you could also store a list of authorized channel names inside the token (that way, you will be able to check access privileges directly from the socket's token instead of having to read the database every time).
              <p>
                The optional <b>options</b> argument is an Object which can be used to modify the token's behavior - Valid properties include any
                option accepted by the node-jsonwebtoken library's sign method.
                <a href="https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#jwtsignpayload-secretorprivatekey-options-callback">See the list of options here</a>.
                Note that if you use a different algorithm than the default 'HS256', you may need to provide an authPrivateKey and authPublicKey instead of the default authKey.
                See authKey, authPrivateKey and authPublicKey options in SocketCluster constructor <a href="/#!/docs/api-socketcluster">here</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using auth tokens has the following advantages:
                <ul>
                  <li>The user doesn't need to login again if their socket loses its connection - Works well with SC's auto-reconnect feature.</li>
                  <li>
                    An auth token is shared between sockets across multiple tabs in a browser (under the same domain name).
                    If a user logs in on one tab, they will automatically be authenticated on any other tab that they have open.
                    Tokens therefore allow you to attach a user's identity to multiple sockets.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>

            <td>deauthenticate()</td>
            <td>
              Disassociate the current socket from its auth token.
              This method will also tell the client socket to remove the token from the browser's cookies.
              This is useful for logging out the user.

              All arguments are optional - If no channel name is provided, it will unsubscribe this socket from ALL channels.
              In addition, the client-side of this socket will emit a 'kickOut' event and a 'dropOut' event to signify that
              it was kicked out of the channel and has dropped out of further messages.
              Note that this doesn't prevent the client from resubscribing to that channel later. You will need to update your middleware
              if you want to achieve this.

        <h1>API - SCWorker</h1>
        <p>
          The SCWorker should be instantiated inside the worker controller file (worker.js).
          The worker controller is the entry point for your application logic.

          Example worker controller:

          <pre class="prettyprint">var SCWorker = require('socketcluster/scworker');

class Worker extends SCWorker {
  // Override the run function.
  // It will be executed when the worker is ready.
  run() {
    this.scServer.on('connection', function (socket) {
      // Handle new connection.
    }
  }

  // You can optionally override the createHTTPServer method if
  // you want to provide an alternative HTTP server to SC.
  // This is for advanced use cases.
  createHTTPServer() {
    var httpServer;
    if (this.options.protocol == 'https') {
      httpServer = require('https').createServer(this.options.protocolOptions);
    } else {
      httpServer = require('http').createServer();
    }
    return httpServer;
  }
}

new Worker();</pre>
        </p>

              The Node.js HTTP server associated with this worker.
              Note that this server's 'request' event will not trigger for requests which are handled internally by SocketCluster.
              If you would like to handle all requests (including ones for URLs reserved by SC), you will need to listen for the 'rawRequest' event.
              This is not recommended though unless you know what you're doing.

          <tr>
            <td>'notice'</td>
            <td>A notice carries potentially useful information but isn't quite an error.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>'exit'</td>
            <td>Happens when this worker exits (sometimes due to error).</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>'ready'</td>
            <td>This signals that the worker is ready to accept requests from users.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>'masterMessage'</td>
            <td>
              Emitted when the master process sends a message to this worker.
              Since SocketCluster version 6.6.0, the handler function accepts two arguments; the first is the data which was sent
              by the master process, the second is a <code>respond</code> callback function which you can call to respond to the
              event using IPC. The <code>respond</code> function should be invoked as <code>respond(error, data)</code>; it is recommended
              that you pass an instance of the <code>Error</code> object as the first argument; if you don't want to send back an error,
              then the first argument should be <code>null</code>: <code>respond(null, data)</code>.
              See <code>sendToWorker(...)</code> method in <a href="/#!/docs/api-socketcluster">SocketCluster (master) API</a> for details on how
              to send a message to a worker from the master process (and how to handle the response from the worker).

            <td>
              Returns the SCServer instance associated with this worker.
              Note that you no longer have to use this method; you can now simply access the worker.scServer property directly instead.

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>getHTTPServer()</td>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>setAuthEngine(authEngine)</td>
            <td>
              Set a custom auth engine for use throughout SC. This new engine will be used internally to create/sign and verify auth tokens.
              The provided auth engine will become accessible from the 'worker.auth' property inside your workerController (worker.js).
              The provided authEngine needs to provide a 'verifyToken' and a 'signToken' method - See the
              <a href="https://github.com/SocketCluster/sc-auth/blob/master/index.js">default engine</a> for details.
            </td>

          <tr>
            <td>sendToMaster(data, [callback])</td>
            <td>
              Send some data to the master process from this worker. You will be able to handle this data from inside the master process by listening for the
              'workerMessage' event. See <a href="/#!/docs/api-socketcluster">here</a> for more details.
              Since SocketCluster v6.6.0, you can provide an optional callback as the second argument; it should be in the
              form <code>function (err, data) { /* ... */ }</code> - Note that the master will need to respond
              to the 'workerMessage' event by invoking a <code>respond</code> function; this is a convenient way to collect data back from the master process in response to this event.
              If the master does not invoke the <code>respond</code> function, then this callback will receive an instance of <code>TimeoutError</code> as the first argument.
              The timeout is defined by the <code>ipcAckTimeout</code> option - See the <a href="/#!/docs/api-socketcluster">SocketCluster (server) API</a> for details.

                        This middleware will run before SocketCluster's underlying HTTP/WS server starts listening for connections - It
                        allows you to perform some async logic to prepare your worker before it starts handling connections.
                        The options object passed to this middleware function will be the SC instance's internal options object.

        <h1>API - Session (nData)</h1>
        <p>
        Can be accessed using socket.session property.
        </p>
        <p>
        The session object is a session-scoped nData client which lets you manipulate session data within a store. It does not
        let you do pub/sub - For this purpose, you need to use the scWorker.global object instead.
        You can use any (non-pub/sub) method of an nData client on instances of this object: <a href="https://github.com/TopCloud/ndata">https://github.com/TopCloud/ndata</a>

        <table class="table">
          <tr>
            <td>emit(event, data)</td>
            <td>
              Emits an event (with data payload) to all sockets which belong to the current session.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>transmit(event, data)</td>
            <td>
              Emits an event to all sockets which belong to the current session except the socket to which the session is currently bound.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>kickOut(channel, message, callback)</td>
            <td>
              All sockets which are part of the current session will be unsubscribed from the specified channel.
              In addition, all client-side sockets will emit a 'kickOut' event and a 'dropOut' event to signify that
              the socket was kicked out of the channel and has dropped out of further messages.
              Note that this doesn't prevent the client from resubscribing to that channel later. You will need to update your middleware
              if you want to achieve this.

        <h1>API - socketCluster (Client)</h1>
        <p>
          This is the root standalone object for the SocketCluster client library - You can
          use it to create socket connections which you can use to interact with
          the server in real-time.
        </p>

        <h3>Properties:</h3>
        <table class="table">
          <tr>
            <td>version</td>

            <td>
              Creates and returns a new socket connection to the specified host (or origin if not
              specified). The options argument is optional - If omitted, the socket
              will try to connect to the origin server on the current port. For cross
              domain requests, a typical options object might look like this (example
              over HTTPS/WSS):
              <pre class="prettyprint">
{
  hostname: 'securedomain.com',
  secure: true,
  port: 443,
  rejectUnauthorized: false // Only necessary during debug if using a self-signed certificate
}</pre>

              <p>Here are some properties that you can provide to the options object:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>hostname:</b> String - Defaults to the current host (ready from
                  the URL).</li>
                <li><b>secure:</b> Boolean - Defaults to false</li>
                <li><b>port</b>: Number - Defaults to 80 if !secure otherwise defaults
                  to 443.</li>
                <li><b>path</b>: String - The URL which SC uses to make the initial handshake
                  for the WebSocket. Defaults to '/socketcluster/'.</li>
                <li><b>query</b>: Object - A map of key-value pairs which will be used as query
                  parameters for the initial HTTP handshake which will initiate the WebSocket connection.</li>
                <li><b>ackTimeout</b>: Number (milliseconds) - This is the timeout for
                  getting a response to a SCSocket emit event (when a callback is
                  provided).</li>
                <li><b>autoConnect</b>: Boolean - Whether or not to automatically connect
                  the socket as soon as it is created. Default is true.</li>
                <li><b>autoReconnect</b>: Boolean - Whether or not to automatically reconnect
                  the socket when it loses the connection.</li>
                <li><b>autoReconnectOptions</b>: Object - Valid properties are: initialDelay
                  (milliseconds), randomness (milliseconds), multiplier (decimal;
                  default is 1.5) and maxDelay (milliseconds).</li>
                <li><b>perMessageDeflate</b>: Boolean - Defaults to false; Turn on/off per-message deflate compression.
                  If this is true, you need to make sure that this property is also set to true on the server-side.</li>
                <li><b>multiplex</b>: Boolean - Defaults to true; multiplexing allows you
                  to reuse a socket instead of creating a second socket to the same address.</li>
                <li><b>pubSubBatchDuration</b>: Number - Defaults to null (0 milliseconds); This property affects channel subscription batching;
                it determines the period in milliseconds for batching multiple subscription requests together. It only affects channels that have the <code>batch</code> option set to true.
                A value of null or 0 means that all subscribe or unsubscribe requests which were made within the same call stack will be batched together.</li>
                <li><b>timestampRequests</b>: Boolean - Whether or not to add a timestamp
                  to the WebSocket handshake request.</li>
                <li><b>timestampParam</b>: String - The query parameter name to use to
                  hold the timestamp.</li>
                <li><b>authEngine</b>: Object - A custom engine to use for storing and
                  loading JWT auth tokens on the client side.</li>
                <li><b>authTokenName</b>: String - The name of the JWT auth token (provided
                  to the authEngine - By default this is the localStorage variable
                  name); defaults to 'socketCluster.authToken'.</li>
                <li><b>binaryType</b>: String - The type to use to represent binary on
                  the client. Defaults to 'arraybuffer'.</li>
                <li><b>rejectUnauthorized</b>: Boolean - Set this to false during
                  debugging - Otherwise client connection will fail when using self-signed certificates.</li>
                <li><b>cloneData</b>: Boolean - If you set this to true, any data/objects/arrays that you pass to the client socket
                  will be cloned before being sent/queued up. If the socket is disconnected and you emit an event, it will be added to a queue
                  which will be processed upon reconnection. The cloneData option is false by default; this means that if you emit/publish an object
                  and that object changes somewhere else in your code before the queue is processed, then the changed version of that object
                  will be sent out to the server.</li>
                <li><b>autoSubscribeOnConnect</b>: Boolean - This is true by default. If you set this to false, then the socket will not automatically
                  try to subscribe to pending subscriptions on connect - Instead, you will have to manually invoke the <code>processSubscriptions</code> callback
                  from inside the <code>'connect'</code> event handler on the client side. See <a href="/#!/docs/api-scsocket-client">SCSocket Client API</a>.
                  This gives you more fine-grained control with regards to when pending subscriptions are processed after the socket connection is established (or re-established).</li>
                <li><b>codecEngine</b>: Object - Lets you set a custom codec engine. This allows you to specify how
                  data gets encoded before being sent over the wire and how it gets decoded once it reaches the other side.
                  The codecEngine must be an object which exposes an <code>encode(object)</code> and a <code>decode(encodedData)</code> function.
                  The encode function can return any data type - Comonly a string or a Buffer/ArrayBuffer.
                  The decode function needs to return a JavaScript object which adheres to the
                  <a href="https://github.com/SocketCluster/socketcluster/blob/master/socketcluster-protocol.md">SC protocol</a>.
                  The idea of using a custom codec is that it allows you to compress SC packets in any format you like (optimized for any use case) -
                  By decoding these packets back into their original protocol form, SC will be able process them appropriately.
                  Note that if you provide a codecEngine when creating a client socket see 'codecEngine', you will need to make sure that the server uses the same codec
                  by passing the same engine to `worker.scServer.setCodecEngine(codecEngine)` when your SC worker initializes on the server side (see 'setCodecEngine' method <a href="#!/docs/api-scserver">here</a>).
                  The default codec engine used by SC is <a href="https://github.com/SocketCluster/sc-formatter/blob/master/index.js">here</a>.</li>

              destroy([options])
            </td>
            <td>
              Completely destroys a connection. You just need to pass the same options object which was passed to <code>socketCluster.connect(options)</code>.
              If you didn't pass any options object on connect, then calling destroy() will cleanup the matching (default) socket.

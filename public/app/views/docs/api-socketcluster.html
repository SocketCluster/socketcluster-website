        <h1>API - SocketCluster (Server)</h1>
        <p>
          The SocketCluster object represents an entire SocketCluster instance (master process which manages a number of child processes).
          This object's constructor accepts an 'options' object which allows you to configure your SC instance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that since SC v2.2.38, the options object can be accessed from any backend process. E.g:
          socketCluster.options (in master process - server.js), worker.options (in workerController) and broker.options (in brokerController).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also add custom properties to the options object if you want to pass data to various processes. Just make sure that whatever custom data
          you provide can be serialized to JSON (so you can't pass functions around - However, you can provide a module name as a string and
          require() the module from inside the target process).
        </p>

        <h1>API - SocketCluster (Server)</h1>
        <p>
          The SocketCluster object represents an entire SocketCluster instance (master process which manages a number of child processes).
          This object's constructor accepts an 'options' object which allows you to configure your SC instance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that since SC v2.2.38, the options object can be accessed from any backend process. E.g:
          socketCluster.options (in master process - server.js), worker.options (in workerController) and broker.options (in brokerController).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also add custom properties to the options object if you want to pass data to various processes. Just make sure that whatever custom data
          you provide can be serialized to JSON (so you can't pass functions around - However, you can provide a module name as a string and
          require() the module from inside the target process).
        </p>

        <h3>Note about <code>options.initController</code></h3>
        <p>
          The <code>options.initController</code> is a module that is to be run before the worker or broker process start.
          It is therefore very important to know, that both the <code>broker</code> and <code>worker</code> object both have a property named <code>type</code>.
          This property allows you to know what kind of process you are bootstrapping.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>initController</code> can be used to allow custom scripting languages to be used within SocketCluster. The following example illustrates usage of such with CoffeeScript:
          <pre class="prettyprint">
// entry.js : We start SocketCluster here.
var SC = new SocketCluster({
  // ... options ...
  initController: "./init.js",
  workerController: "./worker.coffee",
  brokerController: "./broker.coffee"
});

// init.js : This script runs on all processes, before they start.
//           In here, we modify the global namespace, so that SocketCluster can require our .coffee files.
module.exports.run = function(thisProcess) {
  require("coffee-script/register");
}

// worker.coffee : An example CoffeeScript that runs a basic server.
module.exports.run = (worker) ->
  server = worker.getHTTPServer()
  server.on "request", (req, res) ->
    console.log req.method, req.url
    data = 'hi\n'
    res.writeHead 200,
      'Content-Type':     'text/plain'
      'Content-Length':   data.length
    res.end data

// broker.coffee : Just a simple worker.
module.exports.run = (broker) ->
  console.log "Broker on : ", process.pid
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see, we can access the process object and modify the global environment.
          If you decide to use this feature, please be aware that you are intercepting the current environment in which also SocketCluster runs.

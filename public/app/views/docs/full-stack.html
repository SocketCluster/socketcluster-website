        <h1>Full stack pub/sub with SocketCluster</h1>
        <p>
          SocketCluster lets you interact with realtime pub/sub channels from either the client or the server using JavaScript.
          By defining middleware functions, SC gives you absolute control over your realtime data. Middleware can be used to block clients from
          publishing to particular channels but they can also be used to transform your realtime streams (on the backend) before they are shared with other clients.
        </p>

        <p>
          This diagram is a bit generic, but you could assume that channel 1, channel 2, channel 3&hellip; represents different chat rooms which clients can join – Each room could focus on a particular topic, for example let's say 'math', 'physics', 'chemistry' &hellip; To listen to all messages posted in the room 'physics', all you have to do on the client is call: 
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
// SocketCluster API v1.0.0
var physChannel = socket.subscribe('physics');

physChannel.watch(function (data) {...});</pre>
        <p>
          To send messages to the physics room; you would just call:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">socket.publish('physics', messageData);</pre>
        <p>... or</p>
        
        <pre class="prettyprint">physChannel.publish(messageData);</pre>
        
        <p>
          Note that channels don't have to be shared by multiple users - You could setup channels for individual users. For example, the user with username 'bob123' could subscribe and watch the channel 'bob123' - That way if any other user that wants to send some data to bob123, they can simply call:
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">socket.publish('bob123', {from: 'alice456', message: 'Hi Bob!'});</pre>

        <p>
          By default, SC allows anyone to subscribe and publish to any channel they want - It lets you specify middleware on the server to allow or block specific users from subscribing, publishing or emitting certain events. Examples:
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
scServer.addMiddleware(scServer.MIDDLEWARE_SUBSCRIBE, function (socket, channel, next) {
  // ...
  if (...) {
    next(); // Allow
  } else {
    next(socket.id + ' is not allowed to subscribe to ' + channel); // Block
  }
});</pre>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
scServer.addMiddleware(scServer.MIDDLEWARE_PUBLISH, function (socket, channel, data, next) {
  // ...
  if (...) {
    next(); // Allow
  } else {
    next(socket.id + ' is not allowed to publish to the ' + channel + ' channel'); // Block
  }
});</pre>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
scServer.addMiddleware(scServer.MIDDLEWARE_EMIT, function (socket, event, data, next) {
  // ...
  if (...) {
    next(); // Allow
  } else {
    next(socket.id + ' is not allowed to emit the ' + event + ' event'); // Block
  }
});</pre>
        <p>
          SocketCluster also exposes a Global object on the server-side (scServer.global) through which you can publish events to clients:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">scServer.global.publish(eventName, data, cb);</pre>
        <p>
          An emitted event is only sent to the other side of the socket (I.e. server &#8594; client or client &#8594; server); on the other hand, data published to a channel will be sent to all subscribed client sockets (and nobody else!).
        </p>
        <p>
          To subscribe a client socket to a channel, you just use:
        </p>  
        <pre class="prettyprint">
var channelObject = socket.subscribe(channelName);</pre>
        <p>
          Then, to handle incoming channel data, you just use:
        </p>  
        <pre class="prettyprint">
channelObject.watch(handlerFn);</pre>
        <p>
          Note that subscription requests will have to pass through the SUBSCRIBE middleware before the client can receive channel events.

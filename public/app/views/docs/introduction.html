        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          SocketCluster is a fast, highly scalable HTTP + realtime server environment which lets you build multi-process realtime systems that make use of all CPU cores on a machine/instance. It removes the limitations of having to run your Node.js server as a single thread and makes your backend resilient by automatically recovering from worker crashes and aggregating errors into a central log.
        </p>
        <p>
          SocketCluster works like a pub/sub system (which extends all the way to the browser/IoT device) - It only delivers particular events to clients who actually need them. SC is designed to scale both vertically (as a cluster of processes) and horizontally (multiple machines/instances).
        </p>
        <p>
          SC was designed to be modular so that you can run other frameworks like express on top of it (or build your own!).
          SC's realtime API is similar to that of Socket.io.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use SocketCluster as a standalone environment (to act as both a HTTP and Realtime/WebSocket server) or use it only as a realtime engine and serve the client script separately. See <a href="http://npmjs.org/socketcluster-client">http://npmjs.org/socketcluster-client</a>.

        <h2>Memory Leak Profile</h2>
        <p>
          SC has been tested for memory leaks. The last full memory profiling was done on v0.9.17 (Node.js v0.10.28) and included checks on load balancer, worker and store processes.
        </p>
        <p> 
          No memory leaks were detected when using the latest Node.js version. Note that leaks were found when using Node.js versions below v0.10.22 - This is probably the Node.js 'Walmart' memory leak - Not a SocketCluster issue.

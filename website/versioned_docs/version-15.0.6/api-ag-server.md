## Properties

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>exchange</td>
    <td>
      A client which lets you interact with pub/sub channels from the server side.
      (See API section on the <a href="/docs/api-ag-exchange">AGExchange</a> object for details).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>clients</td>
    <td>
      An object which holds all fully connected clients on the current server (only those which have completed the handshake).
      Keys are socket IDs and the values are <a href="/docs/api-ag-server-socket">AGServerSocket</a> instances.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>clientsCount</td>
    <td>
      The number of clients currently connected to this server.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pendingClients</td>
    <td>
      An object which holds all pending clients on the current server.
      Keys are socket IDs and the values are <code>AGServerSocket</code> instances.
      Pending clients are those whose <code>socket.state</code> is 'connecting'; this means
      all sockets which are in the middle of the handshake phase.
      Once a socket completes its handshake, it will be removed from the <code>pendingClients</code> object
      and it will be added to the <code>clients</code> object.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pendingClientsCount</td>
    <td>
      The number of pending clients currently connected to this server.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sourcePort</td>
    <td>The public port on which clients connect to SocketCluster (e.g. 80 for
      HTTP).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>httpServer</td>
    <td>An instance of the Node.js HTTP server to which this SC server is attached.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>secure</td>
    <td>Whether or not this server uses SSL</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>host</td>
    <td>The host name for this server</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ackTimeout</td>
    <td>
      The timeout in milliseconds in which clients have to receive a response to events
      which require acknowledgement. For example, when you call
      <code>socket.invoke(...)</code> or <code>socket.invokePublish(...)</code> on the client.
    </td>

## Events

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>'error'</td>
    <td>This gets triggered when fatal error occurs on this server. The object produced by the listener will have an <code>error</code> property.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>'warning'</td>
    <td>A warning is a non-fatal error which does not require restarting the server. <code>AGServerSocket</code> errors are emitted as warnings on the <code>AGServer</code> instance. The object produced by the listener will have a <code>warning</code> property.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>'handshake'</td>
    <td>
      Emitted as soon as a new <code>AGServerSocket</code> object is created on the server - This occurs at
      the beginning of the client handshake, before the 'connection' event.
      You should not try to send events to the socket while it is in this state. The object produced by the listener will have a <code>socket</code> property.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>'connectionAbort'</td>
    <td>
      Emitted whenever a socket becomes disconnected during the handshake phase. The object produced by the listener will have a <code>socket</code>, <code>code</code> and <code>reason</code> property.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>'connection'</td>
    <td>
      Emitted whenever a new socket connection is established with the server (and the handshake has completed). The object produced by the listener will have a <code>socket</code>, <code>id</code>, <code>pingTimeout</code> and <code>isAuthenticated</code> property. If an authentication error occured during the socket handshake phase, the event object will also have an <code>authError</code> property. The <code>socket</code> object of type <a href="/docs/api-ag-server-socket">AGServerSocket</a> and can be used to interact with the corresponding client.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>'disconnection'</td>
    <td>
      Emitted whenever a connected socket becomes disconnected (after the handshake phase). Note that if the socket connection was not fully established (e.g. during the SocketCluster handshake phase), then the <code>'connectionAbort'</code> event will be triggered instead. The object produced by the listener will have a <code>socket</code>, <code>code</code> and <code>reason</code> property.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>'closure'</td>
    <td>
      Emitted whenever a connected socket becomes disconnected (at any stage of the handshake/connection cycle). Note that this event is a catch-all for both <code>'disconnection'</code> and <code>'connectionAbort'</code> events. The object produced by the listener will have a <code>socket</code>, <code>code</code> and <code>reason</code> property.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>'subscription'</td>
    <td>
      Emitted whenever a socket connection which is attached to the server becomes subscribed to a channel. The object produced by the listener will have a <code>socket</code> (<code>AGServerSocket</code>), a <code>channel</code> and <code>channelOptions</code> property.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>'unsubscription'</td>
    <td>
      Emitted whenever a socket connection which is attached to the server becomes unsubscribed from a channel. The object produced by the listener will have a <code>socket</code> and <code>channel</code> property.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>'authentication'</td>
    <td>
      Emitted whenever a socket connection which is attached to the server becomes authenticated. The object produced by the listener will have a <code>socket</code> and <code>authToken</code> property.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>'deauthentication'</td>
    <td>
      Emitted whenever a socket connection which is attached to the server becomes deauthenticated. The object produced by the listener will have a <code>socket</code> and <code>oldAuthToken</code> property.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>'authenticationStateChange'</td>
    <td>
      Triggers whenever the <code>authState</code> of a socket which is attached to the server changes (e.g. transitions between authenticated and unauthenticated states). The object produced by the listener will have a <code>socket</code>, <code>oldAuthState</code> and <code>newAuthState</code> property.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>'badSocketAuthToken'</td>
    <td>
      Emitted when a client which is attached to the server tries to authenticate itself with an invalid (or expired) token.
      The object produced by the listener will have a <code>socket</code>, <code>authError</code> and <code>signedAuthToken</code> property.

## Stream management methods

These methods should only be used for advanced use cases when you need more control over stream management; for example, when you want to <code>break</code> out of a specific consumer loop without affecting any other consumer.
These methods can also be useful to check that consumers are being cleaned up properly and to selectively kill specific consumers which are causing backpressure to build up.
For most use cases, you should try to stick to the methods in the table above as it will lead to cleaner logic.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      getListenerConsumerStatsList(eventName)
    </td>
    <td>
      Get the list of consumers which are consuming data from the specified event listener. This method returns a list of objects which have an <code>id</code> and <code>backpressure</code> property.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      getAllListenersConsumerStatsList()
    </td>
    <td>
      Get the list of all consumers which are consuming data from any listener on the server. This method returns a list of objects which have an <code>id</code> and <code>backpressure</code> property.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      killListenerConsumer(consumerId)
    </td>
    <td>
      This will cause the target listener consumer's <code>for-await-of</code> loop to <code>break</code> immediately.

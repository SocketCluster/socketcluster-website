## Methods

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>allow([packet])</td>
    <td>
      Allow an action to be processed by the back end server/socket logic. This method accepts an optional <code>packet</code> argument; if provided, the packet will be used as the action payload instead of <code>action.data</code>. This allows middleware to transform data from clients before it is handled by the back end logic.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>block(error)</td>
    <td>
      Prevent an action from reaching the back end server/socket logic. This method accepts an <code>Error</code> as argument. This error will be sent to the client which initiated the action.
    </td>
  </tr>
